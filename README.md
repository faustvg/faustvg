# Hey, I’m Faustino or Faust 👋  
Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a **Data Science undergrad** passionate about tech, finance,maths and statistics. What I enjoy most from data science is diving deep into analyzing data and visualizing insights—especially with historical data. 

I’m a big fan of using Machine Learning and Time Series to uncover patterns, fueled by my avid interest in economics, investing, and trading. I love tackling complex problems and building data-driven projects—stick around to exploit my work in coding and forecasting.
Beyond data, I’m a sports enthusiast, football, american football, and basketball are my favorites. I’m often at the gym working out, running, swimming, or enjoying long bike rides.  When I am not doing numbers or exercising, you’ll find me either watching sport events or reading, especially history book.
